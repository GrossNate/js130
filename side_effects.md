# Practice Problems

1.  1.  `console.log` writes to the console - hence it has **side effects through
        input/output**
    2.  I MISSED: function modifies the array passed in as an argument (**side
        effects through mutation**)
2.  - Function 2 (returns undefined regardless of what's passed to it)
    - Function 3 (for the same a + b it always will return the same value)
    - Function 5 (returns 3.1415 regardless of the inputs)
